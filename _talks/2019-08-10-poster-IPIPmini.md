We evaluated psychometric evidence for two versions of the 20-item Mini-International Personality Item Pool Big-Five Model Inventory (mini-IPIP; Donnellan, Oswald, Baird, & Lucas, 2006) in relation to the 50-item version (IPIP-50) from which they were created (Goldberg, 1992). Results showed that the mini-IPIP provided good psychometric properties in relation to the original 50-item version.  Psychometric properties of the mini-IPIP were improved further by replacing one item in the mini-IPIP Intellect/Imagination scale.
