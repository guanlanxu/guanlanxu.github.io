We integrated bifactor models into multi-occasion G-theory SEM frameworks to allow for expanded score consistency indices; separation of systematic variance into general and group factor effects and measurement error into transient, specific-factor, and random-response effects; and generalization of results to broader domains from which items and occasions were sampled.
