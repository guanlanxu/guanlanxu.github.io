## Abstract

We investigated the effectiveness of Duplicate, Erase, and Replace Augmentation procedures (DupER; Foley, 2010) in calibrating the 3PL model using small datasets in an operational setting. DupER procedures were most effective with medium-sized samples (n = 600) in which imputed datasets adequately reflected the score distribution within the target population.
