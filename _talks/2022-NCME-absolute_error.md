We evaluated the accuracy of Jorgensen (2021)’s method for estimating variance components for absolute error using structural equation models. Results from numerous self-concept and personality measures revealed that Jorgensen’s procedure yielded variance components, generalizability coefficients, and dependability coefficients equivalent to those produced by variance-component programs within R, SAS, and SPSS.
