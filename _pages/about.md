I am an associate research scientist at Pearson. I hold a Ph.D degree in Educational Measurement and Statistics and a M.S degree in Biostatistics from the University of Iowa. My current interests include item response theory (IRT), structural equation modeling (SEM), equating, and other statistical and machine learning models. When I am not doing statistics or data analysis, I like to read books, do yoga, or play piano.
