I am a PhD candidate and a graduate research assistant of Educational Measurement and Statistics at the University of Iowa. My research interests include factor analysis, structural equation modeling, item response theory, and other stastistical modeling. I am also pursuing a MS degree in Biostatistics at the University of Iowa. When I am not doing statistics or data analysis, I like to do yoga and play piano.
